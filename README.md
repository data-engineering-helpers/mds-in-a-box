Modern Data Stack (MDS) in a box
================================

# Overview
[This project](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/mds-in-a-box)
intends to gather referential material and to give practical hints
on how to reprodce locally all-in-one modern data stack (MDS).

Among other use cases, we may think of training, onboarding newcomers,
testing/benchmarking some new components (_e.g._, Delta Lake vs Iceberg
vs Hudi), LakeFS.

Even though the members of the GitHub organization may be employed by
some companies, they speak on their personal behalf and do not represent
these companies.
